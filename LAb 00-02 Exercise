A file defines a set of rectangles with the following format:
* Each row of the file contains 1 string and 2 real numbers:
  - The string (of 4 characters) is the rectangle identifier,
  - The two numbers specify the x and y coordinates,
    respectively, of one of its vertices
* For each rectangle, there are two lines in the file specifying
  the coordinate of two opposite vertices (top-right and
  bottom-left or top-left and bottom-right).
  Notice that, in general, the two rows defining a rectangle are
  not consecutive, and that it is not known which vertex they
  specify.
In any case, suppose the maximum number of rectangles is 100.

Write a C program that receives three file names on the command line:
- The first file is an input file, and it contains all rectangles
  specifications as previously indicated
- The second file is an output file, and it must contain the
  name of the rectangles ordered by ascending area values.
- The third file is an output file, and it must contain the
  name of the rectangles ordered by ascending perimeter values.
